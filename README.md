# THE IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION ON FINANCIAL SYSTEM’S EFFICIENCY AND STABILITY IN INDONESIA
This project between some master student and lecturer from SBM-ITB with Central Bank of Indonesia, Analyzing the effect of digital payment on payment system efficiency and macroeconomic stability towards financial system stability.

This study has two aims:

- first, to evaluate the effect of digital payment on macroeconomic stability 
 
- the second aim is to investigate the implication of digital payment on the payment system efficiency. 

In the model examination, we use electronic money transaction as the proxy for the digitalization. Meanwhile for the first objective, the macroeconomic indicators namely inflation and exchange rate volatility are used as the proxy. Inflation represent the internal stability while the exchange rate volatility represent the external stability. For the second objective, we use ticket sizing of digital payment and private consumption as the proxy for payment system efficiency.

To calibrate the relationship between digital payment on macroeconomic stability as well as on the payment efficiency auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model of Pesaran (2001) is performed. 

Our results show that digitalization, indeed, affect the macroeconomic stability as well as payment efficiency. The electronic money as a proxy of digitalization has positive and significant relation with the exchange rate volatility and inflation. Related to the exchange rate volatility, the change of the monetary multiplier is an important indicator. This indicator shows the share of currency in the money supply. As a result of e-money the currency decreases producing effects to multiplier. Meanwhile the increase in the inflation is due to electronic money provide less transaction cost and increase the number of transaction in the economy.

The electronic money transmissions to the macroeconomics indicator can be explained as follows: the increase of electronic money transaction leads to the increase of Indonesian GDP and next lead to the increase of price level as well as the society’s purchasing power. The increase of price level decreasing Indonesian’s competitiveness compared to the other country’s product which lead to decreasing Indonesian export in the long run and depreciating Indonesian Rupiah relative to other country’s currency. The increase of purchasing power leads to higher import and the effect is the depreciation on Indonesian Rupiah. On the other transmission works as follows: the increase of GDP due to the increase of electronic money leads to the increase of demand for money in loanable fund market and makes the increase for interest rate.  This condition will attract foreign investors to invest in Indonesia’s capital market, thus increase the demand for Indonesian Rupiah, and in the end will makes Indonesian Rupiah to be appreciated relative to other country’s currency.  

Our second examination, the effect of electronic money on payment efficiency reveals that the electronic money has significant and positive association with the payment efficiency. With the electronic money use, the transaction cost become cheaper and increasing the number of transaction in the economy.
